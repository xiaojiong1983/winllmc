Starter pack of a bunch of .bin files for llm.c. You could generate these files yourself by following the README instructions, but this then requires you to download and use Python and PyTorch etc and re-build the Universe, so here we just cache the .bin files, so they can be easily downloaded for use in llm.c. No pythons will be harmed.
